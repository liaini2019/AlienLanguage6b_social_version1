<header><h1><p style="text-align:center">Diplomatic Gathering</p></h1></header>

  <p style="text-align:center"> Now that you have familiarized yourself with the aliens on Ginuli, it’s time to make arrangements for your first event.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> You will be hosting a diplomatic gathering and selecting different delegations of aliens to invite. </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> It is very important that we make a good impression here. </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> One way to do this involves paying attention to the aliens’ outfits. </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> <strong> Clothing matters a lot in making a good impression </strong> to the inhabitants of Ginuli, who care a lot about who wears what. </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> As you will have noticed, some aliens on Ginuli wear blue outfits and some wear black outfits, </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> and each of these two groups (the aliens who wear blue outfits and the ones who wear black outfits) is likely to be annoyed if they think the other group is getting preferential treatment. 

  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> We should therefore <strong> try to invite an equal number of blue-outfitted and black-outfitted aliens to the gathering</strong>.  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> On each of the next few screens you will be presented with two delegations of aliens (often of different sizes) and you must <strong> pick one in each case</strong>. </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> In doing so, <strong>please try to keep an equal number of blue- and black-outfitted aliens overall</strong>.  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center"> If we end up offending one of the groups, we will not make the impact we hope for! </p>
