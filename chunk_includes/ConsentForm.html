<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Primary Investigator:</b> Gareth Roberts, roban@upenn.edu</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You are invited to take part in a research study conducted by Gareth Roberts at the University of Pennsylvania. <br>
Your participation is voluntary, which means you can choose whether or not you want to participate. <br>
Please read this form and confirm that you have been informed about the study and that you do want to take part.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What we are studying:</b> We are studying how people learn and use language.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Why you are being asked to participate:</b> You are a registered member of Prolific, and you have selected this study as a task you are interested in.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What you will do:</b> You will learn a miniature “alien language” and will also learn a little about the aliens who use it. Then you will be asked questions about the language.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Risks:</b> The risks associated with this study are minimal. Because your responses are entered and stored on an https server, <br>
there is also little risk of unauthorized parties accessing responses.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Benefits:</b> Participating in this study will not benefit you directly. You may, however, enjoy contributing to the study of language.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Ending your participation:</b> You can choose whether or not to participate in this study. If you decide to participate now but change your mind later, <br>
you may withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences. You can stop participating at any time by closing your browser window.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Your rights:</b> Participation in this study is entirely <b>voluntary</b>. You may decline to participate or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Confidentiality:</b> In order to keep your information safe, Prolific protects your personal information by assigning you an anonymous worker ID number and operating over a secure server. No identifiable information is revealed to our research team aside from this anonymous worker ID; nor do we solicit this information from you.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Data use:</b> We may share your anonymized data with approved members of our research team, but your ID number will never be associated with any data that is shared. The overall results of this study may be published in scientific journals or discussed at academic conferences, but will never include your ID or any other personally identifying information.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Compensation:</b> You will be paid according to the amount of time the study is expected to take.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Questions?</b> If you have questions about the study, please contact Gareth Roberts by sending a message via Prolific. <br>
If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, you may also contact the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the University of Pennsylvania at 215-898-2614.</span></p>
